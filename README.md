## Scripts

### 1. `spending_categories.py`

This script processes a transaction CSV file, categorizes transactions based on keyword mappings, and visualizes total spending by category. It generates a bar chart summarizing categorized spending and lists transactions that could not be categorized.

#### Usage

```bash
python spending_categories.py <csv_file> <target_budget> <output_path>
```

#### Parameters

- `<csv_file>`: Path to the CSV file containing your transactions.
- `<target_budget>`: Your target spending budget for the period.
- `<output_path>`: Path to save the generated bar chart.

#### Example

```bash
python spending_categories.py transactions.csv 1000 categorized_spending.png
```

---

### 2. `graph_spending.py`

This script visualizes your spending over a 30-day period compared to a target budget. It reads a CSV file of transactions, calculates daily and cumulative spending, and generates a line plot for comparison.

#### Usage

```bash
python graph_spending.py <source_csv> <classification_csv> <target_budget> <output_path>
```

#### Parameters

- `<source_csv>`: Path to the CSV file containing raw transaction data.
- `<classification_csv>`: Path to a CSV file containing transaction classifications.
- `<target_budget>`: Your target budget over 30 days.
- `<output_path>`: Path to save the generated line plot.

#### Example

```bash
python graph_spending.py transactions.csv categories.csv 1500 spending_vs_budget.png
```

---

### 3. `driver_analysis.py`

This script automates the analysis process by identifying the latest transaction file for the previous month, running analysis scripts, and sending notifications via Discord.

#### Usage

```bash
python driver_analysis.py --folder <csv_folder> --classification_csv <classification_csv> --budget <budget> --bot_token <bot_token> --channel_id <channel_id>
```

#### Parameters

- `--folder`: Folder containing CSV files for transactions.
- `--classification_csv`: Path to the CSV file for spending classifications.
- `--budget`: Target spending budget.
- `--bot_token`: Discord bot token for notifications.
- `--channel_id`: Discord channel ID for posting updates.

#### Example

```bash
python driver_analysis.py --folder ./transactions --classification_csv categories.csv --budget 2000 --bot_token BOT_TOKEN --channel_id 123456789012345678
```

---

### 4. `post_to_discord.py`

This script posts messages and images to a Discord channel, optionally processing messages with OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT for better phrasing.

#### Usage

```bash
python post_to_discord.py <bot_token> <channel_id> <message> [<image_path>]
```

#### Parameters

- `<bot_token>`: Discord bot token for authentication.
- `<channel_id>`: ID of the Discord channel where the message will be posted.
- `<message>`: Text message to be posted.
- `<image_path>` (optional): Path to an image file to include with the message.

#### Example

```bash
python post_to_discord.py BOT_TOKEN 123456789012345678 "Budget analysis complete!" spending_graph.png
```

---

### 5. `check_csv_file.py`

This script checks for the presence of a CSV file for the current month and year in a specified folder. If a file is found, it sends a notification to a Discord channel. This is useful for ensuring that transaction data is uploaded in a timely manner.

#### Usage

```bash
python check_csv_file.py --folder <csv_folder> --bot_token <bot_token> --channel_id <channel_id>
```

#### Parameters

- `--folder`: Folder containing the CSV files.
- `--bot_token`: Discord bot token for sending notifications.
- `--channel_id`: Discord channel ID where notifications will be posted.

#### Example

```bash
python check_csv_file.py --folder ./transactions --bot_token BOT_TOKEN --channel_id 123456789012345678
```

#### Functionality

- Searches for a CSV file with the format `<Month> <Year> -*.csv` (e.g., "December 2024 -*.csv").
- Sends a notification to Discord indicating whether the file was found or not.

## Classification.csv Format

The `classification.csv` file is used to define the mappings between transaction descriptions and their corresponding spending categories. Each row in the file represents a specific keyword and its associated category.

### Format

| Grocery          | Take Out         | Coffee           | Eating Out      | Video Games      | Shopping          |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| stop and shop    | chipotle         | blue bottle coffee | chili's        | xbox games       | target            |
| market basket    | taco bell        | peet's coffee     | olive garden   | playstation games | ebay              |
| whole foods      | panda express    | dunkin' donuts    | red robin      | steam games      | vans              |

- **Categories**: The spending categories, such as Grocery, Take Out, etc., listed as column headers.
- **Keywords**: Business names or descriptors matching transactions, listed under the relevant categories.

Ensure that the file is saved in CSV format and that it contains a header row.

### 6. 'fetch_google_drive.py'

This script allows you to download files from Google Drive using the Google Drive API.

#### Prerequisites

1. **Google Cloud Credentials**:
   - Obtain a `credentials.json` file from the Google Cloud Console. This file is required for OAuth authentication.
   - Place the `credentials.json` file in the same directory as the script.

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
   - Install the required Python libraries using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-api-python-client
     ```

3. **Set Up Environment**:
   - Ensure you have Python 3.7 or later installed.
   - Verify you have access to the file you want to download from Google Drive.

#### How to Use

#### Command-Line Usage

Run the script using the following syntax:

```bash
python fetch_google_drive.py <file_id> <destination_path> [--mime_type <mime_type>]
```

#### Required Arguments:
- `<file_id>`: The unique ID of the file on Google Drive. You can find this in the file's URL (e.g., `https://drive.google.com/file/d/<file_id>/view`).
- `<destination_path>`: The path where the downloaded file will be saved. Include the file name and extension (e.g., `./classification.csv`).

#### Optional Argument:
- `--mime_type`: Specify the MIME type for export. For example, use `text/csv` to download a Google Sheets file as a CSV.

#### Example Commands

1. **Download a File in Its Original Format**:
   ```bash
   python fetch_google_drive.py 1A2B3C4D5E6F7G8H9I0J ./output_file.txt
   ```

2. **Download a Google Sheet as CSV**:
   ```bash
   python fetch_google_drive.py 1A2B3C4D5E6F7G8H9I0J ./output_file.csv --mime_type text/csv
   ```

#### Notes

- On the first run, the script will open a browser window for OAuth authentication. This generates a `token.json` file for future use.
- Ensure the script has write permissions for the specified `destination_path`.
- The `token.json` file allows the script to authenticate without requiring repeated logins. If deleted, you will need to reauthenticate.

#### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

1. **`token.json` Errors**:
   - If you encounter errors related to `token.json` (e.g., corruption or missing fields), delete the file and rerun the script to regenerate it.

2. **Permission Denied**:
   - Verify write permissions for the destination directory. Do you have the file open?

3. **`redirect_uri_mismatch` Error**:
   - Ensure the redirect URI is configured correctly in the Google Cloud Console.
