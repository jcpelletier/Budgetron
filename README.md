## Classification.csv Format

The `classification.csv` file is used to define the mappings between transaction descriptions and their corresponding spending categories. Each row in the file represents a specific keyword and its associated category.

### Format

| Grocery          | Take Out         | Coffee           | Eating Out      | Video Games      | Shopping          |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| stop and shop    | chipotle         | blue bottle coffee | chili's        | xbox games       | target            |
| market basket    | taco bell        | peet's coffee     | olive garden   | playstation games | ebay              |
| whole foods      | panda express    | dunkin' donuts    | red robin      | steam games      | vans              |

- **Categories**: The spending categories, such as Grocery, Take Out, etc., listed as column headers.
- **Keywords**: Business names or descriptors matching transactions, listed under the relevant categories.

Ensure that the file is saved in CSV format and that it contains a header row.
